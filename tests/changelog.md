v1.1.3
- Added logic to store the initial sessionId for reference in state table.
- Altered error messages in `/front/meta.php` to be more generic less helpfull for added security
- Added method `getConfigIdByEmailDomain` to `src/config.php` to get IDP ID based on given CONF_DOMAIN
- Added Method `getConfigDomain` to `src/configEntity.php` to fetch the CONF_DOMAIN from the fetched entity used
  to evaluate if the button for the entity needs to be shown.
- Extended `doAuth` in `src/LoginFlow.php` to also evaluate username field in login screen and match it
  with idp configured userdomain. This allows a user to simply 'provide' its username and press login triggering
  a saml request if the domain in the username matches a given idp's userdomain configuration.
- Updated the loginbutton logic to not show on the login page if there are no buttons to show.
- Added a test `popover` in the config screen with the `copy meta url button` to see if that cleans 
  the configuration further and how that would look and feel. Considering to leave it and see if 
  and how ppl respond to it.
